# Introduction

Interactive data graphics provides plots that allow users to interact them. One of the most basic types of interaction is through tooltips, where users are provided additional information about elements in the plot by moving the cursor over the plot.

This paper will first review some R packages on interactive graphics and their tooltip implementations. A new package \CRANpkg{ToOoOlTiPs} that provides customized tooltips for plot, is introduced. Some example plots will then be given to showcase how these tooltips help users to better read the graphics.

# Background

Some packages on interactive graphics include \CRANpkg{plotly} [@plotly] that interfaces with Javascript for web-based interactive graphics, \CRANpkg{crosstalk} [@crosstalk] that specializes cross-linking elements across individual graphics. The recent R Journal paper \CRANpkg{tsibbletalk} [@RJ-2021-050] provides a good example of including interactive graphics into an article for the journal. It has both a set of linked plots, and also an animated gif example, illustrating linking between time series plots and feature summaries.

# Blocking of records using `blocking` function

# Integration with existing packages

# Case study

## Record linkage example

Let us first load the required packages.

```{r packages, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(blocking)
library(data.table)
```

We demonstrate the use of `blocking` function for record linkage on the `foreigners` dataset included in the package. This fictional representation of the foreign population in Poland was generated based on publicly available information, preserving the distributions from administrative registers. It contains 110,000 rows with 100,000 entities. Each row represents one record, with the following columns:

- `fname` -- first name,
- `sname` -- second name,
- `surname` -- surname,
- `date` -- date of birth,
- `region` -- region (county),
- `country` -- country,
- `true_id` -- person ID.

```{r foreigners, echo = TRUE}
data(foreigners)
head(foreigners)
```

We split the dataset into two separate files: one containing the first appearance of each entity in the `foreigners` dataset, and the other containing its subsequent appearances.

```{r split, echo = TRUE}
foreigners_1 <- foreigners[!duplicated(foreigners$true_id), ]
foreigners_2 <- foreigners[duplicated(foreigners$true_id), ]
```

Now in both datasets we remove slashes from the `date` column and create a new string column that concatenates the information from all columns (excluding `true_id`) in each row.

```{r concat, echo = TRUE}
foreigners_1[, date := gsub("/", "", date)]
foreigners_1[, txt := paste0(fname, sname, surname, date, region, country)]
foreigners_2[, date := gsub("/", "", date)]
foreigners_2[, txt := paste0(fname, sname, surname, date, region, country)]
head(foreigners_1)
```

### General use

We use the newly created columns in the `blocking` function, which relies on the default \CRANpkg{rnndescent} (Nearest Neighbor Descent) algorithm based on cosine distance. Additionally, we set `verbose = 1` to monitor progress. Note that a default parameter of the `blocking` function is `seed = 2023`, which sets the random seed.

```{r reclin_nnd, echo = TRUE}
result_reclin <- blocking(x = foreigners_1$txt,
                          y = foreigners_2$txt,
                          verbose = 1)
```

```{r reclin_nnd_calcs}
blocks_tab <- table(result_reclin$result$block)
block_ids <- rep(as.numeric(names(blocks_tab)), blocks_tab+1)
block_size <- as.numeric(names(table(table(block_ids))))
block_count <- as.vector(table(table(block_ids)))
```

Now we examine the results of record linkage.

- We have created `r format(NROW(unique(result_reclin$result$block)), big.mark = ",")` blocks.
- The blocking process utilized `r format(NROW(result_reclin$colnames), big.mark = ",")` columns (2 character shingles).
- We have `r format(block_count[1], big.mark = ",")` blocks of `r block_size[1]` elements, `r format(block_count[2], big.mark = ",")` blocks of `r block_size[2]` elements,..., `r format(block_count[NROW(block_count)], big.mark = ",")` blocks of `r block_size[NROW(block_size)]` elements.

```{r reclin_nnd_summary, echo = TRUE}
result_reclin
```

Structure of the object is as follows:

- `result` -- a `data.table` with identifiers and block IDs,
- `method` -- name of the ANN algorithm used,
- `deduplication` -- whether deduplication was applied,
- `representation` -- whether shingles or vectors were used,
- `metrics` -- metrics for quality assessment (here `NULL`),
- `confusion` -- confusion matrix (here `NULL`),
- `colnames` -- column names used for the comparison,
- `graph` -- an \CRANpkg{igraph} object, mainly for visualization (here `NULL`).

```{r reclin_nnd_str, echo = TRUE}
str(result_reclin, 1)
```

The resulting `data.table` has four columns:

- `x` -- reference dataset (i.e. `foreigners_1`) -- this may not contain all units of `foreigners_1`,
- `y` -- query (each row of `foreigners_2`) -- this may not contain all units of `foreigners_2`,
- `block` -- block ID,
- `dist` -- distance between objects.

```{r reclin_nnd_result, echo = TRUE}
head(result_reclin$result)
```

Let's examine the first pair. Obviously, there are typos in the `fname` and `surname`. Nevertheless, the pair is a match.

```{r reclin_nnd_example, echo = TRUE}
cbind(t(foreigners_1[3, 1:6]), t(foreigners_2[1, 1:6]))
```

Now we use the `true_id` values to evaluate our approach.

```{r reclin_nnd_matches, echo = TRUE}
matches <- merge(x = foreigners_1[, .(x = 1:.N, true_id)],
                 y = foreigners_2[, .(y = 1:.N, true_id)],
                 by = "true_id")
matches[, block := rleid(x)]
head(matches)
```

We have 10,000 matched pairs. We use the `true_blocks` parameter in the `blocking` function to specify the true block assignments. We obtain the quality metrics for the assessment of record linkage.

```{r reclin_nnd_true_blocks, echo = TRUE}
result_2_reclin <- blocking(x = foreigners_1$txt,
                            y = foreigners_2$txt,
                            verbose = 1,
                            true_blocks = matches[, .(x, y, block)])
result_2_reclin
```

For example, our approach results in a `r sprintf("%.2f", (result_2_reclin$metrics)[4]*100)`% false negative rate (FNR). To improve this, we can increase the `epsilon` parameter of the NND method from 0.1 to 0.5. To do so, we configure the `control_ann` parameter in the `blocking` function using the `controls_ann` and `control_nnd` functions.

```{r reclin_nnd_improved, echo = TRUE}
result_3_reclin <- blocking(x = foreigners_1$txt,
                            y = foreigners_2$txt,
                            verbose = 1,
                            true_blocks = matches[, .(x, y, block)],
                            control_ann = controls_ann(nnd = control_nnd(epsilon = 0.5)))
result_3_reclin
```

That decreases the FNR to `r sprintf("%.2f", (result_3_reclin$metrics)[4]*100)`%.

### Integration with the \CRANpkg{reclin2} package

Let us load the \CRANpkg{reclin2} package.

```{r reclin2_load, echo = TRUE}
library(reclin2)
```

Now we present record linkage using the `pair_ann` function. It is based on the `pair_minism` function and reuses some of its source code. The `on` parameter specifies the column names for the approximate nearest neighbours (ANN) search. Setting `deduplication = FALSE` enables record linkage. The function works as follows.

```{r reclin_pair_ann, echo = TRUE}
result_pair_ann <- pair_ann(x = foreigners_1,
                            y = foreigners_2,
                            on = c("fname", "sname", "surname", "date", "region", "country"),
                            deduplication = FALSE)
head(result_pair_ann)
```

The `pair_ann` function returns the total number of pairs. This output can be integrated into the pipeline of the \CRANpkg{reclin2} package. We compare pairs across all selected variables using the Jaro-Winkler distance. The similarity scores are summed across the variables and we set `threshold = 4.5` to accept a pair.

```{r reclin_pair_ann_pipeline, echo = TRUE}
result_pair_ann |>
  compare_pairs(on = c("fname", "sname", "surname", "date", "region", "country"),
                comparators = list(cmp_jarowinkler())) |>
  score_simple("score",
               on = c("fname", "sname", "surname", "date", "region", "country")) |>
  select_threshold("threshold", score = "score", threshold = 4.5) |>
  link(selection = "threshold") |>
  head()
```

We observe that the example pairs are matches.

## Deduplication example

We demonstrate deduplication using the `blocking` function on the `RLdata500` dataset from the \CRANpkg{RecordLinkage} package. Note that the dataset is included in the `blocking` package. It contains artificial personal data. Fifty records have been duplicated with randomly generated errors. Each row represents one record, with the following columns:

- `fname_c1` -- first name, first component,
- `fname_c2` -- first name, second component,
- `lname_c1` -- last name, first component,
- `lname_c2` -- last name, second component,
- `by` -- year of birth,
- `bm` -- month of birth,
- `bd` -- day of birth,
- `rec_id` -- record id,
- `ent_id` -- entity id.

```{r RLdata500, echo = TRUE}
data(RLdata500)
head(RLdata500)
```

We create a new column (`id_count`) that indicates how many times a given unit occurs and then add leading zeros to the `bm` and `bd` columns. Finally, we create a new string column that concatenates the information from all columns (excluding `rec_id`, `ent_id` and `id_count`) in each row.

```{r RLdata500_concat, echo = TRUE}
RLdata500[, id_count :=.N, ent_id]
RLdata500[, bm:=sprintf("%02d", bm)]
RLdata500[, bd:=sprintf("%02d", bd)]
RLdata500[, txt:=tolower(paste0(fname_c1,fname_c2,lname_c1,lname_c2,by,bm,bd))]
head(RLdata500)
```

As in the previous example, we use the `txt` column in the `blocking` function. This time, we set `ann = hnsw` to use the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm from the \CRANpkg{RcppHNSW} package and `graph = TRUE` to obtain an \CRANpkg{igraph} object for visualization.

```{r dedup_hnsw, echo = TRUE}
result_dedup_hnsw <- blocking(x = RLdata500$txt,
                              ann = "hnsw",
                              graph = TRUE,
                              verbose = 1)
```

The results are as follows.

```{r dedup_hnsw_result, echo = TRUE}
result_dedup_hnsw
head(result_dedup_hnsw$result)
```

Now we visualize connections using the obtained graph.

```{r dedup_graph, echo = TRUE, out.width = "100%", fig.width = 6, fig.height=5, layout="l-body"}
plot(result_dedup_hnsw$graph, vertex.size = 1, vertex.label = NA)
```

We create a long `data.table` with information on blocks and units from the original dataset.

```{r dedup_melted, echo = TRUE}
df_block_melted <- melt(result_dedup_hnsw$result, id.vars = c("block", "dist"))
df_block_melted_rec_block <- unique(df_block_melted[, .(rec_id=value, block)])
head(df_block_melted_rec_block)
```

We add the block information to the final dataset.

```{r dedup_blocks, echo = TRUE}
RLdata500[df_block_melted_rec_block, on = "rec_id", block_id := i.block]
head(RLdata500)
```

We can check in how many blocks the same entities (`ent_id`) are observed. In our example, all the same entities are in the same blocks.

```{r dedup_uniq_blocs, echo = TRUE}
RLdata500[, .(uniq_blocks = uniqueN(block_id)), .(ent_id)][, .N, uniq_blocks]
```

Now we can visualize the distances between the units stored in the `result_dedup_hnsw$result` dataset. Clearly we have a mixture of two groups: matches (close to 0) and non-matches (close to 1).

```{r dedup_hist, echo = TRUE, out.width = "100%", fig.width = 6, fig.height=5, layout="l-body"}
hist(result_dedup_hnsw$result$dist, xlab = "Distances", ylab = "Frequency", breaks = "fd",
     main = "Distances calculated between units")
```

Finally, we visualize the result based on the information whether a block contains matches or not.

```{r dedup_density, echo = TRUE, out.width = "100%", fig.width = 6, fig.height=5, layout="l-body"}
df_for_density <- copy(df_block_melted[block %in% RLdata500$block_id])
df_for_density[, match:= block %in% RLdata500[id_count == 2]$block_id]

plot(density(df_for_density[match==FALSE]$dist), col = "blue", xlim = c(0, 0.8), 
     main = "Distribution of distances between\nclusters type (match=red, non-match=blue)")
lines(density(df_for_density[match==TRUE]$dist), col = "red", xlim = c(0, 0.8))
```

Now we compare the evaluation metrics across all ANN algorithms supported by the `blocking` function, i.e. NND, HNSW, Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah (Annoy, from the \CRANpkg{RcppAnnoy} package), Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH, from the \CRANpkg{mlpack} package), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN -- denoted as `"kd"`, from the \CRANpkg{mlpack} package). We use the `rec_id` and `ent_id` columns from the `RLdata500` dataset to specify the true blocks and then calculate evaluation metrics for all algorithms. Additionally, we assess blocking using the `klsh` function from the \CRANpkg{klsh} package, configured to create 10 blocks and 100 blocks, respectively. In both settings, we use 20 random projections and 2-character shingles. The results are as follows (`klsh_10` and `klsh_100` refer to the `klsh` algorithm with 10 blocks and 100 blocks, respectively).

```{r comparision, echo = TRUE}
true_blocks <- RLdata500[, c("rec_id", "ent_id"), with = FALSE]
setnames(true_blocks, old = c("rec_id", "ent_id"), c("x", "block"))
eval_metrics <- list()
ann <- c("nnd", "hnsw", "annoy", "lsh","kd")
for (algorithm in ann) {
  eval_metrics[[algorithm]] <- blocking(x = RLdata500$txt,
                                ann = algorithm,
                                true_blocks = true_blocks)$metrics
}

set.seed(2025)
blocks_klsh_10 <- klsh::klsh(r.set = RLdata500[, c("fname_c1", "fname_c2", "lname_c1",
                                                   "lname_c2", "by", "bm", "bd")],
                             p = 20,
                             num.blocks = 10,
                             k = 2)
klsh_10_metrics <- klsh::confusion.from.blocking(blocking = blocks_klsh_10, 
                                                 true_ids = RLdata500$ent_id)[-1]
klsh_10_metrics$f1_score <- 2 * klsh_10_metrics$precision * klsh_10_metrics$recall / 
  (klsh_10_metrics$precision + klsh_10_metrics$recall)
eval_metrics$klsh_10 <- unlist(klsh_10_metrics)
blocks_klsh_100 <- klsh::klsh(r.set = RLdata500[, c("fname_c1", "fname_c2", "lname_c1",
                                                    "lname_c2", "by", "bm", "bd")],
                              p = 20,
                              num.blocks = 100,
                              k = 2)
klsh_100_metrics <- klsh::confusion.from.blocking(blocking = blocks_klsh_100, 
                                                 true_ids = RLdata500$ent_id)[-1]
klsh_100_metrics$f1_score <- 2 * klsh_100_metrics$precision * klsh_100_metrics$recall /
  (klsh_100_metrics$precision + klsh_100_metrics$recall)
eval_metrics$klsh_100 <- unlist(klsh_100_metrics)

do.call(rbind, eval_metrics) * 100
