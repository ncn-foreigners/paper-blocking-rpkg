Dear Professor Hyndman, \bigskip

Please consider our article titled "blocking: An R Package for Blocking
of Records for Record Linkage and Deduplication" for publication in the
R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the new package called `blocking` and the goal
is to provide blocking methods for record linkage and deduplication
using approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) algorithms and graph
techniques. It supports multiple ANN implementations via `rnndescent`,
`RcppHNSW`, `RcppAnnoy`, and `mlpack` packages, and provides integration
with the `reclin2` package.

The package generates shingles from character strings and similarity
vectors for record comparison, and includes evaluation metrics for
assessing blocking performance including false positive rate (FPR) and
false negative rate (FNR) estimates.

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful
for their work, in particular those who integrate data from various sources.
