Dear Professor Hyndman, \bigskip

Please consider our article titled "blocking: An R Package for Blocking
of Records for Record Linkage and Deduplication" for publication in the
R Journal.

The manuscript introduces a new package called `blocking`, which aims to
provide probabilistic blocking methods for record linkage and
deduplication using approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) algorithms and
graph techniques. It supports multiple ANN implementations via
`rnndescent`, `RcppHNSW`, `RcppAnnoy`, and `mlpack` packages, and
provides integration with the `reclin2` package.

The package generates shingles from character strings and similarity
vectors for record comparison, and includes evaluation metrics for
assessing blocking performance, including false positive rate and false
negative rate estimates.

The package is already available on CRAN, has been included in the
'Awesome Official Statistics Software' list, and was presented at the
Use of R in Official Statistics (uRos) 2024 conference in Greece.

We believe readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for
their work, particularly those who integrate data from various sources.
